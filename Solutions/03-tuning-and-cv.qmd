## Setup

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(here)
```

### Data

In the previous work, we started with `ha_1`, and then `ha_2` magically appeared for us to evaluate our model!

Of course, this is because I randomly "hid" half the data from you, in `ha_2`, before we started.

Now we'll see how one would go about the model selection process starting from all the data:

```{r}
ha <- read_csv(here("Data", "ha_all.csv")) %>%
  mutate(
    cp = factor(cp),
    sex = factor(sex),
    restecg = factor(restecg),
    diagnosis = factor(diagnosis)
  ) %>%
  drop_na()
```

### Recipes and Specs

Copy over your recipe and specification setup code from the last notebook.

```{r}
lr_spec <- logistic_reg()

dt_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_mode("classification")

knn_spec <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 10) %>%
  set_mode("classification")

```

```{r}
rec_1 <- recipe(diagnosis ~ age + chol, 
                data = ha)

rec_2 <- rec_1 %>%
  step_log(chol)

rec_3 <- recipe(diagnosis ~ ., 
                data = ha) %>%
  update_role(Name, 
              new_role = "ID") %>%
  step_dummy(cp) %>%
  step_dummy(sex)  %>%
  step_dummy(restecg)

rec_4 <- rec_3 %>%
  step_normalize(trtbps)

```

::: callout-tip
Don't forget to replace `data = ha_1` with `data = ha`. In principle this doesn't really matter - the data isn't being used in the recipe function, it is only showing the structure of the dataset.

But we no longer have an object named `ha_1` in this notebook!
:::

## Cross-Validation

Recall that our process for evaluating the *accuracy* of a particular workflow went like this:

1.  **Fit** the workflow to some *training* data.
2.  **Predict** values for a separate set of *test* data.
3.  **Calculate** the accuracy metric for those predictions.

Previously we just did this for one possible *test-training split*. But what if we wanted to try the *whole process* on *many different splits*?

And what if we could combine all those steps automatically with one function???

First, let's remake a workflow:

```{r}
wflow_lr <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(lr_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(rec_3)
```

Then, let's establish some splits:

```{r}
ha_cv <- vfold_cv(ha, v = 5)

ha_cv
```

Then, `tidymodels` lets us do everything in one function:

```{r}

cv_results <- wflow_lr %>%
  fit_resamples(ha_cv,
                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))
```

A lot is happening in those two lines of code! Let's recap the process:

1.  From the first fold in `ha_cv`, take only the 218 samples in the training split. Fit the `wflow_lr` workflow on these.

2.  From the first fold in `ha_cv`, take only the 55 test samples. Use the fitted workflow to predict diagnoses of these.

3.  Calculate the `accuracy` of the predictions on the 55 test samples.

4.  Repeat 1-3 for the other folds in `ha_cv`.

5.  Take the average of the 5 accuracies calculated.

Finally, we are left with **one single number**, the average of the five cross-validated accuracies, measuring the "success" of the workflow:

```{r}
cv_results %>% collect_metrics()
```

## Workflow Sets

Let's recap the number of options for modeling process that we have given ourselves in this short time:

-   Four different recipes
-   Three different models specs

If we tried every possible combination of options, we would have to fit 12 models.

Instead of typing each one up by hand, we can tell `tidymodels` to make us a *set* of workflows, and then apply cross-validation to all of the options.

```{r}
ha_models <- 
   workflow_set(
      models = list(LogReg = lr_spec, 
                    KNN = knn_spec, 
                    DecTree = dt_spec),
      preproc = list(simple = rec_1, 
                     simple_log = rec_2,
                     full = rec_3,
                     full_plus = rec_4),
      cross = TRUE
   )
```

A few things to note in this code:

-   The recipe objects and specification objects were created earlier. There's no shortcut around this - you always need to make those decisions manually!

-   We gave all our recipes and specifications descriptive names, to help us differentiate them later.

-   We set `cross = TRUE`, meaning that *all* possible recipe/spec combos will be tried.

More information and examples about workflowsets can be found at: https://workflowsets.tidymodels.org/

Once we have a workflowset, we can automatically compare all our options at once:

```{r}
results <- ha_models %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", 
               resamples = ha_cv,
                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))

results
```

```{r}
results %>% rank_results()
```

```{r}
results %>% autoplot()
```

### Exercises

1.  Based on the above output, what model would you choose to put into production?

> Logistic regression with recipe 3

2.  Suppose you wanted to study the metric ROC-AUC (`roc_auc` in `tidymodels`) instead of accuracy. What would you need to change in the above code?

```{r}
results <- ha_models %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", 
               resamples = ha_cv,
                metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))

```

3.  It seems like workflowsets makes it easy to try many different specs and recipes. What drawbacks do you see to trying more options?

> Just that it takes energy to create the recipes, and it takes computer time to run all the many cross-validations.

## Tuning

If it already feels like we have a lot of model options to try, buckle up, because we have one final complication to add.

Remember how we chose, for KNN, to use 10 as our number of neighbors?

Well, what if we would have better prediction results with a different value of K?

Just as we used cross-validated accuracy to decide on our best workflow, we can also try many different variants of the KNN model specification and compare those.

We start by creating a specification that doesn't commit to a value of `neighbors` - instead, it plans to **tune** that parameter.

```{r}
knn_tune_spec <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) %>%
  set_mode("classification")
```

Next, we make a workflow using our *best* recipe:

```{r}
wflow_knn_tune <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(knn_tune_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(rec_3)
```

Finally, we decide what possible values of `neighbors` we are willing to consider.

```{r}
k_vals <- tibble(
  neighbors = 2:50
)

k_vals
```

::: callout-warning
The name of the data frame can be anything, but the name of the column containing values to use *must* be the same as the name of the input to the `tidymodels` function, i.e., `neighbors`.

There are some shortcuts in `tidymodels` for choosing reasonable possible values.

See this tutorial for a deeper treatment: https://www.tidymodels.org/start/tuning/
:::

Now, we are ready to let `tidymodels` do everything for us!

```{r}
tune_results <- wflow_knn_tune %>%
  tune_grid(
    resamples = ha_cv,
    grid = k_vals,
    metrics = metric_set(accuracy)
  )
```

This process is *just like* workflow sets. A cross-validation is being performed for *each* of the possible workflows: the one with neighbors = 2, the one with neighbors = 3, ...

```{r}
tune_results %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>%
  slice_max(mean)
```

### Exercises

1.  What value of `neighbors` results in the best ROC-AUC score?

> 35, 36, and 40 were all tied

2.  What parameters in the decision tree model are available to be tuned?\
*(If you're feeling ambitious, try one out!)*

> `cost_complexity`, `tree_depth`, and `min_n`

```{r}
dt_tune_spec <- decision_tree(cost_complexity = tune()) %>%
  set_mode("classification")

wflow_dt_tune <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(dt_tune_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(rec_3)
```


```{r}
cc_vals <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(),
                        levels = 10)

cc_vals

```


```{r}
tune_results <- wflow_dt_tune %>%
  tune_grid(
    resamples = ha_cv,
    grid = cc_vals,
    metrics = metric_set(accuracy)
  )

tune_results %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>%
  slice_max(mean)
```


3.  Is there any value of `neighbors` for with the KNN workflow is better than our "best" workflow from earlier, the logistic regression?

> No, the max accuracy achieved was 0.74, and our logistic regression achieved 0.78.

::: callout-tip
It *is* possible to embed the tuning process inside workflowsets, and run all your options together. However, this is a bit more complicated, and only worth your effort to learn if you find yourself doing a large amount of tuning *and* many different model types and recipes.
:::

4. How many times was a model *fit* when the chunk below was run?

```{r}
tune_results <- wflow_knn_tune %>%
  tune_grid(
    resamples = ha_cv,
    grid = k_vals,
    metrics = metric_set(accuracy)
  )
```

> 245 times!  There were 49 different workflows (i.e. different values of `neighbors`), and for each one, we fit the model on each of 5 training sets from the cross-validation folds.
